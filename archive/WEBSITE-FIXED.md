# ✅ Website Issue Fixed - providerutility.rxlive.com

## 🎉 **PROBLEM RESOLVED**

Your website `https://providerutility.rxlive.com` is now working perfectly!

## 🔧 **Issues Fixed:**

### 1. **S3 Bucket Public Access**
- **Problem**: S3 bucket had "Block Public Access" settings enabled
- **Solution**: Disabled all public access blocks and added bucket policy for public read access
- **Result**: S3 website endpoint now accessible

### 2. **CloudFront Origin Protocol Policy**
- **Problem**: CloudFront was configured with `OriginProtocolPolicy: "https-only"` but S3 website endpoints only support HTTP
- **Solution**: Changed to `OriginProtocolPolicy: "http-only"`
- **Result**: CloudFront can now successfully connect to S3 origin

### 3. **Cache Invalidation**
- **Problem**: CloudFront was serving cached error responses
- **Solution**: Created cache invalidation to clear old error responses
- **Result**: Fresh content now being served
